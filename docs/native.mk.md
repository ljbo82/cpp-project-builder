# native.mk

This makefile tries to detect native host and exposes information through output variables.

Currently supported hosts are `linux-x86`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm`, `linux-arm64`, `windows-x86`, `windows-x64`, `windows-arm`, `windows-arm64`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic usage

When this makefile is included, it tries to detect native host and expose information through output variables (in the following example is assumed the existence of the variable `CPB_DIR` pointing the directory where the build system is located):

```Makefile
include $(CPB_DIR)/native.mk
```

!!! Note
    This makefile is automatically included by `builder.mk`.

## Make targets

_This makefile does not expose any target._

## Variables

Following are described all variables used/exported by this makefile:

!!! note "Variable details"
    For each detailed variable, the following fields refer to:

    * **Description:** Contains descriptive information about the variable.

    * **Required:** Defines if a variable must be defined (and it must be non-empty) during build.

    * **Default value:** Contains the value which will be assumed if variable is optional and it is not defined.

    * **Origins:** Contains the list of allowed origins for variable definition.

    * **Restrictions:** Contains information about restrictions on which kind of values that can be stored in the variable.

!!! Warning
    The build system declare internal private variables and functions that are not intended to be used by projects. All of those private variables and functions, have their names prefixed with `cpb_` prefix. Please avoid using/defining variables or functions with names beginning with such prefix.

    The build system checks for attempts to define variables and functions with the same name of reserved ones. Any attempt to define such items will result in errors being raised by the build system.

### Input variables

_This makefile does not expect any variables._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Output variables

The following variables are generated automatically by this makefile in order to expose native host:

#### NATIVE_ARCH

* **Description:** Contains detected native CPU architecture.
* **Required:** Not applicable (variable is set by the build system).
* **Default value:** Detected native CPU architecture. If it would not be possible to detect it, variable will be empty/undefined.
* **Origins:** Not applicable (variable is set by the build system).
* **Restrictions:** This is a read-only reserved variable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### NATIVE_HOST

* **Description:** Contains detected native HOST.
* **Required:** Not applicable (variable is set by the build system).
* **Default value:** Detected native HOST (a combination of [`NATIVE_OS`](#native_os) and [`NATIVE_ARCH`](#native_arch)). If it would not be possible to detect it, variable will be empty/undefined.
* **Origins:** Not applicable (variable is set by the build system).
* **Restrictions:** This is a read-only reserved variable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### NATIVE_OS

* **Description:** Contains detected native operating system.
* **Required:**  Not applicable (variable is set by the build system).
* **Default value:** Detected native operating system. If it would not be possible to detect it, variable will be empty/undefined.
* **Origins:**  Not applicable (variable is set by the build system).
* **Restrictions:** This is a read-only reserved variable.

## Functions

_This file itself does not expose any function explicitly. But since it automatically includes [functions.mk](functions.mk.md), all functions contained there are implicitly exposed after inclusion_.
